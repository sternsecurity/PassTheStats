PassTheStats is a python3 script that quickly generates statistics about cracked credentials.  It takes an input file containing usernames and passwords in the following format  [username]:[password], for example admin:Winter2019

It outputs a summary to the screen and creates a file with more detailed information on passwords.

Run on the command-line with:
$ python3 PassTheStats.py password_file.txt
